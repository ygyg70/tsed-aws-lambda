## Features

- AWS Lambda
- Terraform
- Ts.ED - Serverless and Fullstack framework

## Getting started

This project requires some tools to be installed on your machine. Here is a list of the tools you need to install:

- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fr_fr/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- [Localstack CLI](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/installation/#localstack-cli)
- [Terraform CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

$ yarn install
```

## Development

### Lambda

This command start the lambda function locally.

```batch
# start web server
